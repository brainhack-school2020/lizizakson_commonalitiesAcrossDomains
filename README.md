## Intoduction
I am a 3rd-year PhD student at Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University, Israel. I hold a B.Sc. in psychobiology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I continued to an M.Sc. in brain and behavioral sciences in Ami Citri's lab at the Hebrew University, where I aimed to find the specific neural ensembles in the reward circuitry which are involved in encoding cocaine experience. Following the research experience I gained, I concluded that my passion is neuroscientific human research and specifically decision-making. Therefore, I continued to a PhD in Dino Levy's lab where I examine commonalities between perceptual and value-based processes in order to better understand the neural basis of decision heuristics such as context effects. I use behavioral and fMRI tasks.
Outside the lab, I enjoy theater and improvisation classes, strategy games with friends, yoga and running.

# Project definition
## Background
During the two first years of my PhD, I was concentrating on examining common mechanisms between perceptual and value-based processes. While finding some interesting commonalities, it was hard to ignore the major differences as well. Trying to make sense out of it, I found [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28680161/) great review by Robert P Spunt and Ralph Adolphs from CIT. This review concerns with mechanisms of generaliztion across domains versus specificity of domains. When I was reading it, I was thinking that there might be a common bedding across different domains (e.g. sensory vs. value) but upon this there is also a degree of specification that differntiate between them. An interesting analogy to this is the different complexity levels of deep learning networks that can have a lot of commonalities at certain stages but also a lot of differences at other stages. 

## Aim
The big goal (which I probably would not be able to finish in such limited time) is to use different levels of complexity of DL models in order to predict behavior in different domains using the neural activity that was gained during the task. Specifically, I would like to examine the motor task versus the value-based task from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) data set.
A smaller aim is to build a model to predict the results in the gambling task (gamble/not gamble) using the neural activity.

Then, beacuse I am a bit confused person with too many things going in my mind, there is also this plan (let's say plan c):
- Classify the resting state data accrding to character features (like neuroticism or extroversion).

I am open for more ideas and collaborations!

## Tools
The "project template" project will rely on the following technologies:
- Python
- Nilearn
- Machine learning
- Deep learning (?)
- I would also like to practice other tools, like: terminal and git/github

## Data
I will use data from HCP (or nilearn if HCP will turn out too complicated for this project)

## Deliverables
At the end of this project, I will have a lot of new experience:)

## Results
Will be posted soon.

## To Do:
1. Download the behavioral and neural data from HCP (V)
2. Some behavioral analyses (V)
3. Load the data using nilearn (X)
3. 

## Tools I learned during this project
