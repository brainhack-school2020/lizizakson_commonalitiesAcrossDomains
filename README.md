# lizizakson_commonalitiesAcrossDomains

## Summary
I'm a PhD student at Sagol School of Neuroscience, Tel Aviv University. I hold a B.Sc. in psychobiology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I continued to an M.Sc. in brain and behavioral sciences in Ami Citri's lab at the Hebrew University, where I aimed to find the specific neural ensembles in the reward circuitry which are involved in encoding cocaine experience. Following the research experience I gained, I concluded that my passion is neuroscientific human research and specifically decision-making. In my first project, I'm trying to find a potential link between the mechanisms of perceptual decision making and value-based decision making in order to understand the neural basis of decision heuristics such as decoy effect. I'm using behavioral and fMRI tasks.
Outside the lab, I enjoy theater and improvisation classes, strategy games with friends, yoga and running.

# Project definition
## Background
Examine the common perception of value both in social context and in monetary context. In order to do so, I will use the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and specifically I will Investigate neural commonalities between value-based and social-based task.
My plan is to build a model that predicts the Gambling task's results using the social-related neural activity and vice versa using machine learning and maybe also deep learning.
A second possibility is to classify the resting state data accrding to character features (like neuroticism or extroversion).

## Tools
The "project template" project will rely on the following technologies:
- Python
- Nilearn
- Machine learning
- Deep learning (?)
- I would also like to practice other tools, like: terminal and git/github

## Data
I will use data from HCP.

## Deliverables
At the end of this project, I will have a lot of new experience:)

## Results
Will be posted soon.

## To Do:
1. Download the data from HCP (V)
2. Load the data using nilearn (X)
3. 

## Tools I learned during this project
